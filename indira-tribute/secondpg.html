            <div class="para">
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indira Gandhi was born Indira Nehru, into a Kashmiri Pandit family on 19 November 1917 in
             Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh. Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a leading figure in the 
             Indian movement for independence from British rule, and became the first Prime Minister of the 
             Dominion (and later Republic) of India. Indira was her parents' only surviving child 
             (she had a younger brother who died while young); she grew up with her mother, Kamala Nehru, 
             at the Anand Bhavan, a large family estate in Allahabad.
             <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1930, the Nehru family donated 
             the mansion to the Indian National Congress and renamed it Swaraj Bhavan (meaning abode of freedom). A new mansion was built 
             nearby to serve as the family residence and given the name of the old Anand Bhavan. Indira had a lonely
              and unhappy childhood.Her father was often away, directing political activities or incarcerated, while her mother was 
              frequently bedridden with illness and later suffered an early death from tuberculosis.
             Indira had limited contact with her father, mostly through letters.</p>

                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Indira Nehru was taught mostly at home by tutors and attended school 
                    intermittently until matriculation in 1934. She was a student at the
                     Modern School in Delhi, St. Cecilia's and St. Mary's Convent schools in 
                     Allahabad, the International School of Geneva in Geneva, the Ecole 
                     Nouvelle in Bex in Vaud, Switzerland, and the Pupils' Own School in Poona in 
                     Maharashtra and in Bombay, which is affiliated with the University of
                      Mumbai.
                      <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;  She and her mother moved to the Belur Math headquarters
                       of the Ramakrishna Mission where Swami Ranganathananda was her guardian.
                    Indira then studied at the Vishwa Bharati in Santiniketan, 
                    which became Visva-Bharati University in 1951.

                    In September 1942, Indira Gandhi was arrested over her role in the Quit
                     India Movement. She was released from jail in April 1943."Mud entered
                      our souls in the drabness of prison," she later recalled her time in the
                       jail. She added, "When I came out, it was
                     such a shock to see colors again I thought I would go out of my mind."
