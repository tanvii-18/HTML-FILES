       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American veteran politician Henry A. Kissinger had described Indira Gandhi
            as being an "Iron lady",a nickname that became associated
            with her tough personality. After leading India to victory 
            against Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, President V. V.
             Giri awarded Gandhi with India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna.
            In 2011, the Bangladesh Freedom Honour, Bangladesh's highest civilian award for 
            foreign nationals, was posthumously conferred on Gandhi 
            for her "outstanding contributions" to Bangladesh's Liberation War.</p>

                 Gandhi's main legacy was standing firm in the face of American pressure
                to defeat Pakistan and turn East Pakistan into independent Bangladesh.
                She was responsible for India joining the group of countries with nuclear
                weapons.Although India being officially part of the Non-Aligned
                Movement, she gave Indian foreign policy a tilt towards the Soviet bloc.
                In 1999, Gandhi was named "Woman of the Millennium" in an online poll
                 organised by the BBC.[10] In 2012, she was ranked number seven on Outlook 
                 India's poll of the Greatest Indian.

                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Being at the forefront of Indian politics for decades, Gandhi left a powerful
                  legacy on Indian politics. Similarly, some of her actions have also caused
                controversies. One of the criticisms concerns her rule to have damaged internal
                 party democracy in the Congress party. Her detractors accuse her of weakening 
                State chief ministers and thereby weakening the federal structure, weakening the 
                independence of the judiciary, and weakening her cabinet by vesting power in her 
                secretariat and her sons. Gandhi is also associated with fostering a culture of 
                nepotism in Indian politics and in India's institutions.She is also almost singularly
                 associated with the period of emergency rule, described by some as a "dark period" in Indian
                 democracy.The Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India which was adopted during 
                 the emergency can also be regarded as part of her legacy. Although judicial challenges and
                 non-Congress governments tried to water down the amendment, the amendment still stands.
